/**
 * Definition
 * The pattern is applied to encapsulate or centralize the interactions amongst
 * a number of objects. Object orientated design may result in behavior being
 * distributed among several classes and lead to too many connections among
 * objects. The encapsulation keeps the objects from referring to each other
 * directly and the objects don't hold references to each other anymore.
